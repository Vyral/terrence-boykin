Do you worry when you go out shopping recently? Are you concerned for your kids when they leave your home? If so, we have you covered. Today I’m speaking with Tina Owens of Damsel in Defense about how to protect you and your family at home and beyond.&nbsp;

**Tina, what do you do, and how do you make people feel safer in today’s world?&nbsp;**

I’m a personal safety specialist, so my job is to keep families protected in an unpredictable world. I also provide non-lethal alternatives to self-defense weapons. A lot of people don’t want to carry a gun or knife around with them, and I completely understand, so I make sure I cover everyone’s needs.

**What are a few of the products you’ll have at our safety workshop on August 10?**

One of my favorite products is a keychain stun device. This doubles as an LED flashlight, so you don’t have to worry about getting lost at night. Plus, it has a disable pin. If you get into a fight with someone and they take this keychain from you, they won’t be able to use it against you.&nbsp;

Another one of my favorite products is pepper spray. The pepper spray I sell is stronger than the kind police officers carry, and it’s the strongest kind that’s commercially available.&nbsp;

Finally, roadside emergency kits are always crucial to have around. This is a great thing to give to your children, especially if they’re in college. The last thing you want is for your child to take a road trip with college friends only to have their car break down on the side of the road. My emergency kit will make sure they have everything they need to survive this situation.&nbsp;

**What do you offer your clients that they can’t get from a company like Amazon?&nbsp;**

When you buy something on Amazon, you don’t know what you’re getting until it’s too late. On the other hand, I can answer any questions you might have before you make a purchase. Plus, all my products come with a lifetime warranty.&nbsp;

**What’s the best way people can get in contact with you?&nbsp;**

My website, [www.stylingsafety.com](http://www.stylingsafety.com), is probably the easiest way, but you can always call me at (919) 757-1650 or email [tina@stylingsafety.com](mailto:tina@stylingsafety.com).&nbsp;
