How can a homebuyer seminar help you? Many people think that they probably don’t need to attend. I’m here to tell you that there’s a lot you probably don’t know about buying a home. I’m so excited to tell you about our first-time homebuyer seminar, which will be held at our office Saturday, November 5, from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. We’ll have speakers, lunch will be provided, and **we’ll be giving away prizes.&nbsp;**

Did you know that if it’s been more than three years since you last bought a home, **you’re now technically considered to be a first-time home buyer?** Do you know what programs are available to first-time home buyers? Did you know that different programs require different credit scores? Have you heard about the new 2-1 buydown, which is the popular thing right now? Do you know the pros and cons of this kind of buydown? Those are just a few of the questions that our lenders and credit repair people will answer at our workshop.

Do you know what to look for when touring a home? What cracks coming from the door frame might mean? Or maybe cracks in the mortar? **What smells can be an instant red flag?** Do you know what cloudy windows mean? Are creaking floors really a problem? We’ll have a home inspector who can answer all your questions about the condition of your next house.&nbsp;

Why is it important to read and understand the restrictions and covenants? Do they matter if the neighborhood doesn’t have a functioning HOA? **Did you know that, in some neighborhoods, you can’t even park your car in the driveway overnight?** Will you be able to build a fence or a storage shed? If you’re interested in generational wealth: Will you be able to rent that property out when you buy your next house? We’ll have an attorney speaking who can answer all of those legal questions that you might have.

What are the most costly repairs you will encounter as a homeowner? Is it possible to negotiate those repairs before you purchase the home? Should you have them done before the purchase or after you take ownership? What happens if something breaks during the first year of home ownership? **Do all of the same rules apply if you buy new construction?** We’ll have a home insurance provider and a home warranty provider there to answer your questions about repairs, both before and after you purchase the home.

Those are just a few of the topics that we’ll be covering at our first-time homebuyer seminar. Remember, it’s Saturday, November 5, from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. We’d love to have you join us, no strings attached. It’s just for everyone’s education.
