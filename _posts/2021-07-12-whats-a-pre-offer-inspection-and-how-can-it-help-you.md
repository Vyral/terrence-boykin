I’m here today to give you buyers a little insurance on your next home purchase. Low inventory is dominating the market, and it’s leading buyers to have to pay a higher due-diligence fee. This fee is paid to a home seller once we go under contract so the buyer can do their home inspection and appraisal.&nbsp;

When I started in this business, due-diligence fees were anywhere from $500 to $1,500. **Today, these fees are commonly $15,000 to as much as $100,000.** As an agent, I don’t feel great about that because I have a fiduciary responsibility to my clients and it just doesn't seem right to put $100,000 down as a nonrefundable fee.&nbsp;

I was talking to my home inspector buddy Michael Szeto about this a few months ago and he told me about a tool he’s using called the pre-offer inspection. He’s here today to explain a little bit more about what that is and how it works.
