Today I am very excited to tell you that I’m now the area director for a new way of listing homes called 72 Sold. **This program is a patented seven-step process, and the goal is to sell your home in eight days.** It will bring the sense of urgency to your listing that we saw over the last two years.&nbsp;

72 Sold is an international company that does billions of dollars in sales and was recently recognized as a leading home-selling program in America. It has been featured on ABC, NBC, CBS News, and Forbes. Also, it’s the only real estate organization in America chosen to partner with the National Football League and Major League Baseball teams.&nbsp;

This program offers an alternative to the traditional way of selling, and it is simple and convenient. Plus, a two-and-a-half-year independent study of over 200,000 home sales in one of the largest markets showed that **sellers who used the 72 Sold program had an average sales price of 12% above the local MLS average.** Using 72 Sold will benefit you greatly.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how we can get your home sold in eight days and sell it for 12% above the market rate, call or email.
