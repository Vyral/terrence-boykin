I’m here with Jason White, who works in home insurance and is a former police officer, and we wanted to talk a bit about how to keep your home safe. This is a question I get a lot. I also get a similar question of, “Which neighborhoods are the safest?” As a quick disclaimer, I am not allowed to answer that as a North Carolina Realtor, but someone like Jason may be able to answer your questions on that.

**You can watch the full video above, or skip around to topics you’re interested in via the timestamps provided below for your convenience:**

0:50 — Make sure your home looks lived in

1:17 — Make sure the home is well lit and investing in cameras or alarm systems

1:46 — Lock your doors

2:18 — Timers for your lights

2:57 — Some more inexpensive ideas

3:31 — Putting up signs

4:02 — Questions about crime in specific neighborhoods

5:06 — Home insurance

5:36 — Wrapping up

I hope this gave you a few ideas to help protect your home. Again, if you have any questions about specific neighborhoods or home insurance, you can give Jason a call at 919-275-1780. If you have any other real estate questions, feel free to give me a call. I’d love to help.
