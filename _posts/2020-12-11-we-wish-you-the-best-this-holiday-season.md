<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Thank you for your role in making our 2020 a positive year.</em></p>

We did it\! Can you believe it? We actually made it to the end of 2020. To put it lightly, it's been a year full of unique challenges—ones I hope we never have to face again. 

Now that we’ve finally reached the holiday season, it’s time to sit back, relax, and celebrate with our family and friends. For my family, it was a good year overall; for my business, it was a blockbuster year—the best year we’ve ever had, to be exact. Of course, that wouldn’t have been possible without your support. I want to say thank you to all of you—our clients, friends, family, and referral partners—for making our success possible in these otherwise uncertain times.&nbsp;

I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving and are now gearing up for a very merry Christmas, a happy new year, and an all-around stellar holiday season. Even though everyone’s festivities will likely look a little different this year, we can still enjoy our loved ones, load up on plenty of great food, and make special memories. As always, we’re here to help you should you have real estate needs or general questions; we’d love to hear from you soon. Either way, we look forward to seeing you in 2021. Stay safe, and happy holidays from our family to yours\!&nbsp;
