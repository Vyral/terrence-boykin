In the Triangle Area, people come from everywhere. Whether you’re heading in from New York, Wisconsin, Texas, or anywhere else, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of relocation. Today I want to give you five tips to make sure your long-distance move goes as smoothly as possible:&nbsp;

**1\. Keep your lender updated.** They will need to know if you’re quitting your job, transferring to a new position, or working remotely. I know someone personally who had their move jammed up because their lender didn’t have all the necessary paperwork, and I’d hate to see that happen to you.&nbsp;

**2\. Make sure you can close remotely.** If you’re selling your home in one state and buying in another, closing remotely can help. This way, you can sign your seller document before the closing date, travel to your new location, and show up in person to close on your new home.&nbsp;

**3\. Factor in moving.** Plan ahead and line up your movers. You may even need a contingency in your offer. Reach out to your movers and see what type of flexibility they have.

**4\. Have backup housing.** I’m not saying you should have a backup house. Just make sure you have a place to lay your head for a few days if your closing gets delayed. You can time things perfectly and still have something go wrong, so have backup housing just in case.&nbsp;

**5\. Keep your important medication with you.** It can be so easy to pack up your medicine in a box and forget about it until you’re in your new home. However, if your boxes don’t show up on time, or if the closing runs into a snag, you’ll wish you had your medicine on you.&nbsp;
