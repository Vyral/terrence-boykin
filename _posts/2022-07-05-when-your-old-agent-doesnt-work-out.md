What can you do if your real estate agent isn’t cutting it? Not every agent meets their client’s standards, so how do you break off your professional relationship the right way?&nbsp;

First, don’t rush into termination. If you and your agent are never on the same page, it could just be a communication issue. **That’s why I recommend you call or email your agent as soon as you feel like there’s an issue** and ask them if they have a solution. In most situations, they’ll respond quickly with an answer that works for both of you.&nbsp;

In the rare case where you need to let go of your old agent, you have to let them know. If you don’t, your old contract with them will still be in place, which could lead to complications down the road. As soon as you find another agent you’d rather work with, send your old agent an email and inform them that you want to terminate your buyer agency agreement.

When I work with a buyer or seller, the termination form is the first thing I show them. I’ll even leave them a copy. **That way, they know that they can leave at any time if I don’t hold up my end of the bargain.&nbsp;**

You don’t owe your former agent anything once you cancel your contract by default. However, some agents add in fees that are due at the end of the contract—whether they find you a home or you terminate the buyer agency agreement. Sometimes marketing and other fees are justified because your agent goes the extra mile to help you, but some agents just put these in to pressure you into not canceling your contract. **When you interview an agent, see if they’re charging you fees and ask them why they’re necessary.**&nbsp;

Another thing you should do when interviewing agents is to listen. Do they tell you what happens if you aren't happy with their service? Many agents want to avoid the topic altogether and sweep it under the rug.&nbsp;

I hope you never have to cancel a contract with an agent, but you deserve to know that it’s within your rights. If you have questions about today’s topic or anything else, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!
