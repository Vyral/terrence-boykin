<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Bridge loans aren’t exactly new, but here’s why they’re game-changing.</em></p>

Today I’m joined by Eduardo Rodriguez of Fidelity Bank to talk about an important lending program that can help many home sellers-turned-buyers in this fast-paced, low-inventory market of ours: bridge loans. Most Realtors don’t know much—if anything—about the magic of bridge loans, but the flexibility they offer can unlock tons of opportunities. Given the lingering presence of COVID and the subsequent lockdowns, it’s still very difficult to show houses from a safety and convenience standpoint; a bridge loan enables you to qualify for, purchase, and then move into a new house before selling your current one as vacant, which means you won’t have to be bothered by showings.&nbsp;
