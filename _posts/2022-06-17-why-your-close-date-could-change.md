Your house might not close on the day that it’s supposed to—today I’ll discuss a few of the reasons why that might happen.

As agents, we try to be proactive when it comes to making sure a house closes on the designated date. However, certain factors aren’t within our control.

On the buying side, for instance, the lender will dive into the buyer’s credit history 14 days before the closing date. During that credit check, **the lender may find something that affects the buyer’s ability to qualify for a loan**, such as a large purchase that changes their debt-to-income ratio. That could slow down the closing process.

On the other side, the sellers could be waiting for a HUD or a USDA payoff; government agencies tend to work at their own pace. In the North Carolina offer to purchase, there’s a built-in grace period that both the buyer and seller can use to extend the closing date by seven business days.

Be sure to let your movers know in advance that there’s a possibility that your moving date could shift so that you’ll know if they’re still available. If necessary, **you should also work with your agent to find alternative housing** between homes so that you don’t end up sleeping in your car. If you have pets, it might be wise to look into a pet boarder since not all Airbnbs and hotels allow pets.

If you have any questions about the offer to purchase, listing agreement, or anything else to do with real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be more than happy to have a conversation with you.
