Are you ready to buy a house, but not really sure what to do? Our first-time homebuyer seminar could be the perfect thing for you.

I'm Terrence with Boykin Realty, brokered by Keller Williams, and I'm here today to tell you about **our first-time homebuyer seminar that we'll be having on November 5th at 10 a.m.** at our office in Garner. We're having this seminar because we've come across many buyers who are ready to buy a home but don't know what to do.

They're not prepared to find a lender. They don't know where their credit score is. Most people don't even know how their credit score will affect buying a house. Many people don't know what to look for in a home and don't know the time frame from when they go into a contract until the time it closes. Also, most people aren't prepared for the mountains of paperwork.

On November 5 at 10 a.m., we're going to have three panels set up. The first panel will have the following.

* **Realtor**. We'll have a realtor talk to you about the basics of finding out what exactly it is that you want in a home where you want to be and what to look for.

* **Lender**. To discuss and inform you of the pre-approval and pre-qualification process, as well as some of the documentation you'll need for that.

* **Credit Repair Person**. Many people may have some issues with their credit or don't even know where their credit is. They’ll be able to give you some quick tips on getting your credit in the best position to buy that house.

Our second panel will be all about finding that perfect house and going under contract. We'll have an agent talk to you about that process and an inspector who will provide insight about some of the things to look for when you are looking for that perfect home.&nbsp;

Our third panel will have **a real estate agent who will walk you through the process** from going under contract up until the closing day. We'll have an attorney to answer any questions you have about the legal side of the closing. We'll also have another lender on this panel to talk to you about the underwriting process, which is very important for the closing.

Lastly, **we’ll have a person who sells home warranties** talk to you about the importance of having a home warranty to make sure everything runs the way it's supposed to in the house during your first year.

I know that was a lot to take in. Trust me, this buyer seminar will be well worth your time. Again, it's November 5 at 10 a.m. in our office in Garner. Sign up by going to this link; don't worry, it's at no cost to you and there will be food provided. We’d love to help you\!
