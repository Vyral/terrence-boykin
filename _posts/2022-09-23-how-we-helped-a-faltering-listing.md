A friend of mine recently contacted me about a house that had been on the market for two weeks and had only had two showings. At that time, the market was starting to change—prices were beginning to settle, multiple offers had all but disappeared, houses were staying on the market longer, and housing inventory was starting to rise.&nbsp;

The seller decided to separate from the agent that had listed her house and called me for help. **I explained to her the five strategies I would use to get her home sold** and let her know a little bit about the buyer profile that we were going to focus on for the sale.

After a week to get the marketing set, I listed it. After about a week, we had a full-price offer from a buyer that almost perfectly fit the buyer profile that we had discussed. I was able to list the home and sell it before the market shifted further. This just goes to show you need to make sure you’re working with the right agent the first time.

Give me a call or email, and let's sit down to discuss your needs and come up with a plan to get your house sold right the first time. I look forward to hearing from you.
