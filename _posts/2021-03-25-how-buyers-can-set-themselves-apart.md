At Boykin Realty, we’re always looking for innovative ways to put our buyers ahead of their competition in the market. Today I invited Brad Siebert from Interlink Mortgage Services to tell us about a new loan program that can help buyers close on a home in less than 20 days in some cases. That’s an amazing opportunity because sellers are looking at cash offers first and financed offers second. The closing period is a huge selling point for them; if you can guarantee a quick close, it’ll put you way ahead of the rest of the market.
