Forbearance is over—are you going to lose your home? I’m here to talk about your options. Forbearance was put in place during the pandemic because a lot of people were out of work and couldn’t pay their mortgages. The mortgage companies allowed homeowners to skip their payments for up to a year and effectively parked that money. It wasn’t forgiven; they just allowed owners to repay it later.

Even though forbearance has ended, you still might be in a great position as a homeowner. **In 2021, we saw a 19% increase in home prices, so you have more equity in your home.** Chances are, you can sell and still have money in your pocket after closing. If you’re in this sort of equity position, forbearance isn’t an issue for you.

**The next option is to refinance.** You may be able to work something out with your current lender. If not, you can move to a new lender, roll the year of missed payments into the new loan, and have a great interest rate. If you haven’t refinanced in the last 18 months, you might end up with a lower rate than you have now and save a bit of money.&nbsp;

The final option is to talk with your lender and work out a repayment schedule. Since forbearance effectively paused your payments, you may be able to continue paying your same rate. In this case, **that extra payment might come due when you sell or pay off your loan.&nbsp;**

Just because forbearance is over doesn't mean the sky is falling. You still have plenty of options. If you have any questions, just give my team a call at 919-675-9967. We would love to talk with you and put you in touch with a few of our lenders.
