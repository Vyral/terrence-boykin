Today I’m joined by Michelle Kaufmann from Prime Lending to discuss financing during the coronavirus situation. When COVID-19 was just starting, I invited Michelle here to talk about the economics of the pandemic, so I thought she’d be a great person to have back. Today we’re going to examine how the health crisis has impacted financing, forbearance, and the latest good news in these areas.
