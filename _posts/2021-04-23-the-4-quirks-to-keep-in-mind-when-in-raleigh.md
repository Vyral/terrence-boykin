I work with a lot of people moving into Raleigh from other areas of the country, and in our interactions, it’s usually easy to tell they’re not from around here. We do things a bit differently in North Carolina, so today I’d like to provide some helpful tips for people who are thinking about moving to Raleigh:

**1\. “15 minutes” does not equal 15 minutes.** If someone tells you it’ll only take about 15 minutes to get somewhere, it’s probably going to take somewhere closer to 45 minutes to an hour.&nbsp;

**2\. What “you good” actually means.** To most people, “you good” sounds like a different way of saying, “Are you okay?” It can still mean that in Raleigh, but it can also mean, “No need to say sorry,” or “Stop talking to me,” or many other things. So, when you hear “you good” in a conversation, think about it.

**3\. The city takes snow seriously.** If you hear the weatherman say it might snow, Raleigh is going to shut down. Whether they forecast two centimeters or two feet, you’re not going to work and your kids aren’t going to school for the rest of the week. Here’s another quick tip: Avoid the grocery store during snowy weather if at all possible—people get ferocious over bread and milk.

**4\. “Bless your heart” is a sign of trouble.** This phrase is used a lot by the older, Southern women who live in our area. These ladies are wonderful, but if you hear one say, “Bless your heart,” end the conversation immediately and get out of there. Why? Because “bless your heart” is basically a nice way of saying, “You’re stupid.”&nbsp;

Hopefully, these tips will help prepare you for some of the quirks that come along with our city. If you’re wanting to find a home in our community, or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
