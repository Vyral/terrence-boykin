Are you ready for a new career? I’m asking because now is a great time to be a Realtor. Home prices are up and the market has never been hotter. People often tell me that they’ve thought about a career in real estate once or twice, but for whatever reason, they’ve never been able to commit. Today, I’ll go over the main reasons I think now is the perfect time to finally begin your career in real estate.&nbsp;

The first reason I think now is the right time to get started in real estate is, of course, the pandemic. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, a lot of people lost their jobs and have been stuck indoors for over a year. During this time, they’ve realized that they never want to go back to their old job again.&nbsp;

If you feel this way, real estate is a great option. You get to be in control of your own business, so you never have to feel like you’re being forced to do something you don’t want to. Also, there is a direct correlation between the hard work you put into your job and the hard cash you put into your hands. Real estate can be very rewarding, so if you can’t imagine going back to your pre-pandemic job, now might be the time to make a change.&nbsp;

Another great reason to get started in real estate is to secure a better financial future. At the end of the day, what matters most is securing a better future for yourself and your family, and real estate is a great way to do it. A lot of people don’t know that you only need a high school diploma to get started in real estate, so there’s no need to be worried about your educational background. Within a few years, you can be making life-changing cash as an agent, especially in today’s hot market.&nbsp;

The last reason you might want to start a career in real estate is if you are about to retire. When a lot of people retire, they worry they won’t know what to do with themselves without the satisfaction and structure of their job. Starting a career in real estate can be a great side job to have in retirement. Because you control how much you work, you can sell homes at your leisure. People tend to pick up new hobbies in retirement. Why not get some extra cash from yours?&nbsp;

Hopefully, these ideas made you think about what could be possible through real estate. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call. No matter what state you’re in, real estate is real estate, and I’d be more than happy to answer your questions.&nbsp;
