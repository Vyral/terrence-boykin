Today I’m speaking with Jason White, a great friend of mine and ex-Raleigh police officer. I wanted to talk with him because we have an upcoming safety workshop on August 10, 2022. This workshop will be about how families can stay safe in our current environment. Today we’ll discuss Jason’s background and what we’ll cover in our workshop.&nbsp;

**So Jason, what is your background?**

I spent five years on patrol in the Raleigh police force, but before that, I worked in other police departments and as a firefighter. What we want to focus on is situational awareness, especially while your kids are out during high school and college.&nbsp;

**A lot of young people are glued to their phones. Will you address this at your workshop?**

Absolutely. When I was a police officer, I saw many cases where people were taken advantage of because they just weren’t paying attention. Whether they were looking at their phone, focused on a conversation, or something else, they had something keeping their attention away from present danger.

**How will you address this at our workshop?**

I think one of the most important things you can do is have a plan and maintain situational awareness. We’ll discuss that in more detail in our workshop.&nbsp;

I would like to thank Jason once again for speaking with me. Email him at [Jason.white@ncfbins.com](mailto:Jason.white@ncfbins.com) if you have any questions. Check out this link if you’d like to sign up for our workshop and learn more about it. I look forward to seeing you there\!&nbsp;
