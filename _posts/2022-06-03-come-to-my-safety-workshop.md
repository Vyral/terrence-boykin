Today I want to talk about you and your family's safety. Do you know what to do if something happens? I have a solution for you.

You’ve probably noticed the uptick in crime across the country. There have been more shootings, carjackings, home invasions, and muggings lately. Most of us don't know what to do. We try to keep our heads down and not be seen, but unfortunately that doesn't always work.

**I'll be holding a safety workshop in our office in Garner on Wednesday, August 10, at 6 p.m.** to help our clients and friends with some of these safety issues. We're going to talk about topics like: how to protect your home, how to teach yourself and your kids about situational awareness, and what your kids can do now that they are at college and away from home.

Jason White is one of my insurance providers, and he's a retired Raleigh police officer. He'll give us some insight along with another gentleman that trains law enforcement officers. Tina Owen will also show some different products that you and your family can use to stay safe.

You can sign up for this workshop here. If you have any questions give me a call at (919) 675-9967. I look forward to hearing from you.
