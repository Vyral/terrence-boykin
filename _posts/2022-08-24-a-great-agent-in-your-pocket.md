The Triangle area market is changing. What do you do when you list your house and it doesn’t sell? The recent market has been a roller coaster, and it seems like it’s only been going up. However, what goes up must come down eventually. Are all real estate agents prepared for the descent?

The reality is that they aren’t. North Carolina added almost 19,000 new agents in the last two years, and **most of those have never listed a home that was on the market for more than two weeks.** They haven’t had to reduce prices and have rarely negotiated any concessions. They have relied on the three P’s program: taking photos, putting a sign out front, and praying another agent supplies buyers. Do you want that kind of agent handling one of the most significant financial decisions of your family’s life?

I’ve developed five strategies to get homes listed, marketed, and sold that work in any market. In the last seven years, 97% of homes I’ve listed have sold. I can sell your home, too.&nbsp;

To learn more about these strategies or if you have any questions, give me a call or send an email so we can discuss your options. You can also click the “home value report” link on this page. You’ll simply give me some information about your house so we can get started selling your home.&nbsp;

**Not in the Triangle? No worries\!** I have connections with great agents across the country who would love to help you with your home. I look forward to hearing from you.
