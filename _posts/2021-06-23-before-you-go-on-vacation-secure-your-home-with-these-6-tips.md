The hot summer season is finally here, and a lot of people are taking the opportunity to plan a getaway after being cooped up in the house for the last year. If you’re getting ready to go on vacation, though, you want to make sure to prepare your home before you leave. **Here are the six things you should do:**

**1\. Clean the kitchen:** Get rid of the perishables on your countertops and in your pantry, fridge, and cabinets. You may also want to put some vinegar and water down the sink. Make sure all your appliances are turned off, and don’t forget to flush all the toilets, either\!

**2\. Get light timers:** These inexpensive timers will turn your lights on and off at certain times, making it appear like you’re home and warding away intruders.

**3\. Turn off the water supply:** Make sure it’s shut off for the interior of your home, just in case. You don’t want to return to a flooded house.

**4\. Tell your neighbors:** Let your neighbors know you’ll be gone so they can keep an eye on your property. They can also pick up any packages that may be left by your door. If you’ll be gone for an extended period, you may want to get your mail put on hold until you return.

**5\. Leave a car in the driveway:** This makes it look like someone is home, which keeps “unwanted guests” away.

**6\. Take care of your lawn:** You don’t want to come home to a jungle, so mow the grass and trim the hedges before you head out.
