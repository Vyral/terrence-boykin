Today I’m joined by Justin Kearney of Equity Holder Mortgage to discuss finances. Justin and I have been marveling at the fact that some of our clients who just bought homes six months ago are already able to refinance now and save money. However, as Justin pointed out, you really need to get the ball rolling if you plan to refinance; if you wait, you’ll get hit with a new government-issued lending fee. Even though this fractional fee will apply to every lender, most homeowners aren’t even aware it’s coming. Exploring your refi options as soon as possible will likely save you a whopping $11,000.&nbsp;
